The data for this application is stored in MySQL database.  The SQL part is simple, and could be switched with another database system, but both the python code and the 
PHP use MySQL specific libraries that would need to be replaced.

The steps to install this application are:<ol>
<li>Create database using 'create' scripts
<li>Copy scripts/lib/weather.conf.template to scripts/lib/weather.conf and edit to fit your system

<li>Add 'stations' to the 'stations' table
<li>Run 'nws_3day_scraper.py' python script to pull data
<li>Optional: if you want to automate the data retrieval, put the 'run_nwis_3day_scraper.vbs' (or other version) in the Task Manager.  have it run every 1 hour.
<li>Move the 'www' folder to a subfolder of inetpub/www, or other place on non-windows machine. You can also use the folder where it is using a 'Virtual Directory' in IIS
<li>Copy www/lib/weather.conf.php.template to scripts/lib/weather.conf.php and edit to fit your system
<li>Navigate to your new web application and make sure things are working.
<li>Option: for production systems, change the error reporting to not display errors.
